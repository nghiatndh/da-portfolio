### [Airbnb Price Prediction with What-If Scenario Analysis] ()
**Overview**:
This project applies supervised regression techniques to an Airbnb listings dataset to estimate nightly rental prices. The workflow includes comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and rigorous performance validation using cross-validation techniques to ensure generalizability.

A key enhancement of this project is the integration of a scenario simulation component. The what-if analysis allows users to modify input features (e.g., property characteristics or listing configurations) and observe the corresponding impact on predicted prices. This transforms the model from a static predictive tool into an interactive decision-support system.

The entire workflow was implemented in a structured and reproducible Jupyter Notebook environment.

**Tools & Technologies**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib-seaborn.

**Results**: 

+ Achieved stable and reliable predictive performance validated through cross-validation.
+ Demonstrated the model’s ability to generalize across unseen data.
+ Successfully implemented a scenario-based pricing analysis tool, enabling users to evaluate the financial impact of listing adjustments.
+ Provided interpretable insights into the relative influence of property features on rental pricing.
