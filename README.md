## About:

I am a recent Information System major graduate with a strong foundation in data analytics and machine learning, seeking an opportunity to begin my career as a Data Analyst. I have hands-on experience working with real-world datasets to build predictive models, perform cross-validation, and generate actionable insights using Python, SQL, and data visualization tools.

Through projects in healthcare prediction, financial risk assessment, and pricing analytics, I have developed strong analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and attention to data quality. I am eager to apply my technical skills in a professional environment while continuing to grow as a data-driven decision-maker.
## Professional Experience:
## Projects:

### [Airbnb Price Prediction with What-If Scenario Analysis](https://github.com/nghiatndh/Airbnb-Price-Prediction-with-What-If-Scenario-Analysis/blob/master/What_if_Analysis_Cross_Validation.ipynb)

**Goal**: The objective of this project was to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting Airbnb listing prices based on property and host features. In addition to predictive modeling, the project aimed to implement a what-if scenario analysis framework to evaluate how changes in key listing attributes influence pricing outcomes. This approach supports data-driven pricing strategies and decision-making for short-term rental stakeholders.

**Overview**:

This project applies supervised regression techniques to an Airbnb listings dataset to estimate nightly rental prices. The workflow includes comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and rigorous performance validation using cross-validation techniques to ensure generalizability.

A key enhancement of this project is the integration of a scenario simulation component. The what-if analysis allows users to modify input features (e.g., property characteristics or listing configurations) and observe the corresponding impact on predicted prices. This transforms the model from a static predictive tool into an interactive decision-support system.

The entire workflow was implemented in a structured and reproducible Jupyter Notebook environment.

**Tools & Technologies**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Matplotlib-seaborn, GridSearchCV.

**Results**: 

+ Achieved stable and reliable predictive performance validated through cross-validation.
+ Demonstrated the model’s ability to generalize across unseen data.
+ Successfully implemented a scenario-based pricing analysis tool, enabling users to evaluate the financial impact of listing adjustments.
+ Provided interpretable insights into the relative influence of property features on rental pricing.

### [Diabetes Prediction with Cross-validation](https://github.com/nghiatndh/Diabetes-prediction-with-cross-validation)

**Goal**: The aim of this project was to design and evaluate a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic patient features. The project emphasized rigorous model validation through cross-validation to ensure robust generalization and reliable performance on unseen data, enhancing its applicability in healthcare analytics and early diagnosis support.

**Overview**:

This project applies supervised classification techniques to a diabetes dataset, leveraging clinical input variables such as glucose levels, BMI, and age to classify whether a patient is likely to develop diabetes. The workflow encompasses data cleaning, feature scaling, model selection, and cross-validation to assess predictive performance and avoid overfitting.

Using industry-standard machine learning libraries in Python, the project delivers a reproducible and transparent analytical pipeline, suitable for clinical data exploration and predictive modeling. The results include comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualizations that benchmark model effectiveness.


**Tools & Technologies**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, GridSearchCV.

**Results**: 

+ Developed a predictive classification model with consistent performance across cross-validation folds.
+ Achieved strong predictive accuracy on held-out data, demonstrating reliable generalization.
### [Credit Card Approval Prediction](https://github.com/nghiatndh/credit_card_approval)

**Goal**: The objective of this project was to develop a data-driven classification model that predicts credit card application approvals based on applicant attributes. By leveraging machine learning techniques and systematic evaluation using cross-validation, the project aims to enhance decision support in financial risk assessment and automate credit evaluation with high reliability.

**Overview**: 

This project applies supervised learning methods to a real-world credit card approval dataset to classify whether prospective applicants are likely to be approved. The analytical workflow includes comprehensive data preprocessing, feature transformation, model selection, and robust validation using k-fold cross-validation to ensure consistent performance.

The solution not only generates strong predictive capability but also illustrates how machine learning models can augment traditional credit scoring processes, providing interpretable insights for financial institutions and data practitioners.

**Tools & Technologies**: Power BI, Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, GridSearchCV, Matplotlib-seaborn.

**Results**:

+ Built a machine learning classifier that achieved reliable performance across validation folds.

+ Demonstrated robust accuracy and balanced evaluation metrics, confirming consistent model behavior.

+ Feature analysis provided actionable insights into the most influential applicant attributes affecting credit decisions.
